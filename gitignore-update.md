**Updating your `.gitignore` and removing previously committed files**
#
1.  **Make desired changes to `.gitignore` file:**
    * Ensure your `.gitignore` file accurately reflects the files and directories you want Git to ignore. Double-check for typos and correct patterns.

2.  **`git rm -r --cached .`:**
    * **WARNING:** `git rm -r --cached .` will remove *all* files from Git's staging area. This can be dangerous if your `.gitignore` file is not correct.
    * `git rm --cached $(git ls-files -o -i --exclude-from=.gitignore)` This may be safer as it removes only the files that are currently being tracked by Git but are also listed in your `.gitignore` file.

3.  **`git add .`:**
    * This command adds all remaining changes in your working directory to the staging area.

4.  **`git status`:**
    * Carefully review the output of `git status`. This shows you exactly which files are staged for commit. Verify that only the intended changes are included and that no unwanted files are being added or deleted. This is the last chance to catch errors before committing.

5.  **`git commit -m "Remove files ignored by .gitignore"`:**
    * Commit the changes.

6.  **`git push`:**
    * This command updates the remote repository with your local changes.
